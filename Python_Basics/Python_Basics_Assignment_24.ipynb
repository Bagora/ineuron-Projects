    "'''Ans 6:- Designing functions effectively is crucial for writing clean, maintainable,\n",
    "and efficient code. Here are some general guidelines to consider when coding\n",
    "functions:  \n",
    " \n",
    "1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):- Each function should have a\n",
    "clear and singular purpose. It enhances readability and makes the function more\n",
    "reusable. \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Descriptive Naming:- Choose meaningful and descriptive names for your\n",
    "functions that convey their purpose and usage. A good function name is self-explanatory.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Modularity:- Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable\n",
    "functions. This promotes code reuse and makes debugging and testing easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Consistency:- Maintain a consistent style and naming convention\n",
    "throughout your codebase. Consistency improves readability and reduces confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Avoid Side Effects:- Minimize side effects—functions should ideally modify\n",
    "only the variables they receive as parameters and return values instead of\n",
    "modifying external state.\n",
    " \n",
    "6. Keep Functions Short:- Aim for shorter functions with fewer lines of code.\n",
    "This aids in understanding the function's behavior at a glance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Use Meaningful Parameters:- Choose descriptive parameter names that\n",
    "indicate the role of each argument. This makes it easier for others (or your future\n",
    "self) to understand the function's usage.  \n",
    "\n",
    "8. Limit Function Arguments:- Avoid excessive numbers of arguments. If a\n",
    "function requires too many arguments, consider grouping related arguments into objects\n",
    "or data structures.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Avoid Global Variables:- Minimize the use of global variables within\n",
    "functions. Pass required data through parameters instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Document Your Code:- Include clear and concise comments or docstrings that\n",
    "explain the function's purpose, expected inputs, outputs, and any important\n",
    "considerations. \n",
    "\n",
    "11. Error Handling:- Address potential errors by including appropriate error\n",
    "handling mechanisms, such as try-except blocks or raising custom exceptions. \n",
    " \n",
    "12. Testing:- Write testable functions by keeping their logic separate from\n",
    "input/output and using dependency injection when needed. Writing tests helps catch bugs\n",
    "early. \n",
    "\n",
    "13. Avoid Nested Functions:- If a function is not reused and only used within\n",
    "another function, consider whether it can be refactored to promote better code\n",
    "readability.   \n",
    "\n",
    "14. Avoid Magic Numbers:- Replace hardcoded constants with named constants or\n",
    "parameters to improve code clarity and maintainability. \n",
    "\n",
    "15. Performance Considerations:- Balance code readability with performance.\n",
    "Don't prematurely optimize functions unless performance is a critical concern. \n",

    "\n",
    "2. Output Parameters: Instead of returning a value, functions can modify the\n",
    "values of variables passed as arguments (output parameters). This approach is less\n",

    "values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Global Variables: While not recommended due to potential issues with\n",

    "\n",
    "4. Exceptions: Functions can raise exceptions to indicate errors or exceptional\n",
    "conditions. While exceptions are often used for error handling, they can also be used to\n",
    "communicate specific results or states to the caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Callback Functions: Functions can accept other functions (callbacks) as\n",
    "arguments. These callbacks can be invoked by the function to communicate results or\n",
    "actions back to the caller. This approach is common in asynchronous programming and\n",
    "event-driven architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Data Structures: Functions can modify or return complex data structures, such\n",
    "as lists, dictionaries, or custom objects, to communicate multiple results or\n",
    "structured data to the caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Printing: Functions can use print statements to display information in the\n",
