    "'''Ans 1:- The difference between enclosing a list comprehension in square brackets ([])\n",
    "and parentheses (()) lies in the type of resulting object and its behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Square Brackets ([]): When we use square brackets to enclose a list\n",
    "comprehension, it creates a new list. The list comprehension iterates over the input iterable\n",
    "(e.g., another list, tuple, or range), applies the defined expression or function to\n",
    "each element, and generates a list of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Parentheses (()): When we use parentheses to enclose a list comprehension, it\n",
    "creates a generator expression. A generator expression generates values lazily as they\n",
    "are needed, instead of generating all values upfront like a list comprehension.\n",
    "This can save memory and improve performance when working with large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the key distinction is that using square brackets creates a list,\n",
    "while using parentheses creates a generator expression. If you need to use the\n",
    "results multiple times or if memory usage is not a concern, using a list comprehension\n",
