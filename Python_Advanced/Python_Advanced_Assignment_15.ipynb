    "1. Assignment Expressions (The Walrus Operator :=): Allows assignment within\n",
    "expressions. This helps in reducing code repetition and improving readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Positional-only Parameters: Functions can now specify parameters as\n",
    "positional-only, ensuring that they can only be passed using positional arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. f-strings Improvements: Allows the use of = to display expressions and their\n",
    "values in formatted strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. future Annotations: The __future__ module introduces forward compatibility for\n",
    "proposed changes. For example, annotations was introduced to standardize function and\n",

    "8. Performance Improvements: Various performance enhancements were made across\n",
    "the standard library and CPython implementation.\n",

    "9. Deprecations and Removals: Several outdated or redundant features and modules\n",
    "were deprecated or removed.\n",

    "'''Ans 2:- Monkey patching in Python refers to the practice of dynamically modifying or\n",
    "extending the behavior of existing modules, classes, or functions at runtime. It\n",
    "involves adding, modifying, or overriding code in existing objects without altering\n",
    "their original source code. Monkey patching is typically done to address bugs, add\n",
    "features, or change behavior without waiting for an official update or release.\n",

    "1. Maintenance Challenges: Monkey patches can lead to confusion and maintenance\n",
    "issues, as they can make code harder to understand and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Compatibility: Changes made through monkey patching might not be compatible\n",
    "with future updates or different environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Collisions: Multiple patches applied by different parts of the code can\n",
    "conflict with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Readability: Monkey patches can make code less readable and harder to follow,\n",
    "leading to difficulties in understanding its behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Testing: Monkey patches can complicate testing, as they might alter expected\n",
    "behavior and make test cases harder to manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its drawbacks, monkey patching can be useful in certain scenarios,\n",
    "such as applying fixes to third-party libraries without waiting for official\n",
    "updates or experimenting with new behavior. However, it's recommended to explore\n",
    "alternative solutions, like subclassing or using decorators, which can provide more\n",
    "structured and maintainable ways to extend or modify functionality.'''"
