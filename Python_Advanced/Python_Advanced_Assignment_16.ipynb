    "'''Ans 1:- Regular expressions (regex) offer several benefits when working with text data\n",
    "and pattern matching in programming:-\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pattern Matching: Regular expressions provide a powerful and flexible way to\n",
    "search for and match patterns within strings. They allow you to define complex search\n",
    "patterns using a compact syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Text Manipulation: Regular expressions enable you to perform text manipulation\n",
    "tasks such as searching, replacing, and extracting specific parts of strings with\n",
    "ease. This is particularly useful for tasks like data cleaning and transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Efficiency: Regular expressions are optimized for efficient pattern matching.\n",
    "They often outperform manual string manipulation methods when dealing with complex\n",
    "patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Flexibility: Regular expressions support a wide range of patterns and rules,\n",
    "including character classes, quantifiers, alternatives, and more. This makes them\n",
    "suitable for handling various text processing scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Cross-Language Support: Regular expressions are supported in many programming\n",
    "languages, not just Python. This makes it easier to apply your knowledge across different\n",
    "projects and languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Validation: Regular expressions are commonly used for data validation tasks,\n",
    "such as checking if an email address or phone number follows a specific format.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Shorter Code: Regular expressions can often replace multiple lines of code\n",
    "with a single expression, making code more concise and easier to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Advanced Search and Replace: Regular expressions allow you to perform complex\n",
    "search and replace operations, such as finding all occurrences of a pattern and\n",
    "replacing them in a specific way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite their benefits, regular expressions can also be complex and hard to\n",

    "'''Ans 5:- Compiling a regular expression object in Python using the re.compile()\n",
    "function offers several benefits that can enhance the performance and readability of\n",

    "multiple times, leading to faster pattern matching operations, especially when the same\n",
    "pattern is used frequently.\n",

    "readability, as the purpose of the regular expression is clear at a glance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Reduced Overhead: Compiling a regular expression object involves some initial\n",
    "overhead, but the compiled object can be reused efficiently. This reduces the overhead\n",
    "associated with parsing and processing the regular expression pattern each time it's\n",
    "used.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Avoiding Redundant Compilation: In some cases, we might use the same regular\n",

    "that we don't redundantly compile the same pattern in different places, saving\n",
