    "'''Ans 1:- The purpose of Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to facilitate\n",
    "the design, organization, and development of software systems by modeling\n",
    "real-world entities and their interactions in a more intuitive and structured manner. OOP\n",
    "is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of \"objects,\" which\n",
    "are instances of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, classes serve as blueprints for creating objects. They encapsulate\n",
    "data (attributes) and behavior (methods) relevant to a particular entity, allowing\n",
    "developers to define and manipulate complex data structures more efficiently. OOP offers\n",
    "several key benefits:-\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modularity and Reusability: OOP promotes modularity by breaking down complex\n",
    "systems into smaller, manageable classes. These classes can be reused in different\n",
    "parts of the application or in other projects, reducing redundant code and saving\n",
    "development time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Abstraction: OOP allows developers to create abstract classes that define a\n",
    "set of common properties and behaviors shared by multiple related classes. This\n",
    "abstraction simplifies code design and makes it easier to adapt to changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Encapsulation: OOP supports encapsulation, where the internal workings of a\n",
    "class are hidden from external entities. This improves security, as sensitive data\n",
    "can be protected and accessed only through well-defined interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inheritance: Inheritance enables the creation of new classes (subclasses)\n",
    "based on existing classes (superclasses), inheriting their attributes and methods.\n",
    "This promotes code reuse and allows for hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Polymorphism: Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated\n",
    "as instances of a common superclass. This promotes flexibility and allows for\n",
    "dynamic method invocation, enhancing code extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Readability and Maintenance: OOP's structure mirrors real-world concepts,\n",
    "making the code more intuitive and readable. Additionally, the compartmentalized\n",
    "nature of classes simplifies debugging and maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's OOP capabilities, with its concise syntax and dynamic typing, make it\n",
    "an effective tool for designing scalable and maintainable applications. By\n",
    "encapsulating data and functionality into coherent classes and objects, OOP promotes\n",
    "efficient code organization, extensibility, and collaboration in software development\n",
    "projects.\n",
    "\n",
